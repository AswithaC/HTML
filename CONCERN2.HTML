    <H3>MY PRE SCHOOL DAYS</H3>
    <P>My first day of preschool was one of the most exciting days of my life. My mom signed me in as I ran to the classroom ready to meet my new teacher and classmates. When I enter in the classroom door, a parent volunteer parent asked me "What’s your name?" In a sweet, gentle voice, waiting to fill out my name tag.  “Crystal!” I yelled loudly. As I walked to my seat, I met two new friends Ashely and Maria.  We have a lot of things in common, such as pink backpacks, curly black hair, and sparkly shoes.</P>

    <H3>MY SCHOOL DAYS</H3>
    <P>School Life is the best time of our life as we make new friends, learn new things and build our career there. School time is the only time which we enjoy most, and when we enter college, we always miss our school life. School life teaches us lots of new things and prepares us to face all the challenges of life. I love my school life and really enjoy it. I have lots of friends, and all my teachers love me. I love my school and enjoy going there every day to meet my friends and learn new things. </P>

    <H3>MY COLLEGE DAYS</H3>
    <P>College Life is one of the most remarkable and lovable times of an individual's life. Unlike School Life, College Life has a different experience, and a person needs to have this experience in his/her life. College Life exposes us to whole new experiences which we always dream of experiencing after our school life.</P>
