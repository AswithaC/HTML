    <p style="color: maroon;">My life is the result of my perspective. The sum of the actions which I am responsible. Some life are labeled as 'Great','Legend', and so on because they somehow figured out a way to lead in their life. I always thought how easy the life of Usain Bolt, he knows that his life depends on how fast he can run. Yes, I agree the training and hard work besides you are not the only guy is aiming at it. But what I am saying is, it is very easy to lead if you have a solid plan or aim. And if you do that your life will be also be labeled later.</p>
